## Project Description  
 The main purpose of this project is to implement a simple C-to-LLVM IR compiler with ANTLR and JAVA.  
+ generate a lexical analyzer to recognize the vocabulary of c subset and transform a string of characters into a string of words or tokens 
+ generate a parser to verify the strings can be generated by the grammar of C.
+ generate the immediate code with java

## Run
You have to make the antlr-3.5.2-complete.jar and makefile in current folder and the environment of java has been installed,and run the following command:  
(*if you want to generate test1.c immediate code*)
```shell
make 
java -cp ./antlr-3.5.2-complete.jar:. myCompiler_test test1.c >> test1.ll
```
or  
```shell
java -cp ./antlr-3.5.2-complete.jar org.antlr.Tool myCompiler.g
javac -cp ./antlr-3.5.2-complete.jar:. *.java
java -cp ./antlr-3.5.2-complete.jar:. myCompiler_test test1.c >> test1.ll
```
